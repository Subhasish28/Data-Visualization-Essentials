It is rare that you get data in exactly the right form you need it. Often you’ll need to create some new variables, rename existing ones, reorder the observations, or just drop registers in order to make data a little easier to work with.
This is called data wrangling (or preparation), and it is a key part of Data Science. Most of the time data you have can’t be used straight away for your analysis: it will usually require some manipulation and adaptation, especially if you need to aggregate other sources of data to the analysis.
In essence, raw data is messy (usually unusable at the start), and you’ll need to roll up your sleeves to get to the right place. For this reason, all the activity you take to make it “neat” enough is as important as the algorithms you choose to work with. In almost all cases, the data-wrangling piece is a prerequisite to the math/modelling and a majority of the time is spent on cleaning the data in a real-world scenario.
Let’s face it: data won’t be ready or able to be consumed by any algorithm without extra effort.
So, let’s discuss some concepts that will help you face this sometimes seemingly titanic task. In practical terms, datasets can be considered as tables composed of variables (columns), and observations (rows):
